# Budget-Tracker

Offline functionality was added to an already functioning budget tracking web application. 

The offline functionality allows users to update their deposits as well as their expenses offline and have the information populate the page when the application is brought back online. 

The application is helpful for users who need to keep track of their money but do not always have a guaranteed network connection.
